the first thing I want to create is a grid of div. Let's see if I can do that directly in HTML and CSS and later going to Javascript.

# Let's create this grid through Javascript

It has to be inside the first <div class="container">. 

I need to create three divs with a class of "item-cont" and inside them 3 divs with a class of "item".
